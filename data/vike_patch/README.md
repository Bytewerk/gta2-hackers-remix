Here's a patch file that turns the latest official GTA2.exe into
[Vike the Hube's enhanched GTA2](http://gtamp.com/gta2).

It was created using the bsdiff algorithm (with [this](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff) library), but it has a different format than the official [bsdiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) tool. This patch get applied by the code in `src/menu/rpc`.

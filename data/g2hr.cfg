# SLOTMACHINE MODE (not implemented yet), when enabled:
# - replaces the 'QUIT' button in the main menu with a 'POWER OFF'
#   button. the cmds must be native commands (when running on Linux,
#   those will not get executed through wine, but directly in Linux!).
# - adds an extra button for the credits, that does not quit the game.
# - (... maybe more features in the future?)

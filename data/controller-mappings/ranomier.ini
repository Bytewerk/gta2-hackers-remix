; Format spec: http://git.io/g2hr-mappings
;
; Just trying stuff out here, the file format will change!
; Also it is probably not (or not fully) getting parsed yet!
; In the end, these files will be configurable by users.


; In the first approach, we'll just support buttons here.


; Multiple keys should be listed like: attack = A, B, X, Y


; switch start and select. Start should be something that pauses the
; the game, quits it or switch to main menu.

; it would be awesome, if you could just point in the direction you want
; walk

; right stick to look around
; left stick honk the horn


; Deadzone config:
; best would be if one could set the degree of each direction from 0
; to 45 degree.

; TODO: Add the key names to the wiki!

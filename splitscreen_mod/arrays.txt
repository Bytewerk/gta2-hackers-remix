AutoIt3 abstracts all the Windows API stuff to an easy
scripting language, that's why we use it in this project.

However, it doesn't really support C-structs or objects,
so we need to keep such information in arrays. Here's
the documentation.

$config:
[0]: (String) Full path to GTA2.exe (with GTA2.exe at the end)
[1]: (int) Fullscreen Width
[2]: (int) Fullscreen Height
[3]: (int) Border size (TODO)
[4]: (bool) Merge windows to a big one
[5]: (int) Sleep before merge (in ms)
[6]: (bool) Hide windows taskbar
[7]: (int) Player Count (2-6)
[8]: (int) Screen Layout ID (>=0)
[9]: (bool) is running in Wine (Linux)?

$geo (geometrical data):
[0]: (int) x-pos
[1]: (int) y-pos
[2]: (int) width
[3]: (int) height

$player_res:

AutoIt3 abstracts all the Windows API stuff to an easy
scripting language, that's why we use it in this project.

However, it doesn't really support C-structs or objects,
so we need to keep such information in arrays. Here's
the documentation.

$geo (geometrical data):
[0]: (int) x-pos
[1]: (int) y-pos
[2]: (int) width
[3]: (int) height

$gameinfo:
[0]: (int) players (>=2)
[1]: (int) screen layout (>=0)
[2]: (String) map
[3]: (String) game type ("Frags" | "Points" | "Tag")
[4]: (int) winning condition (points or tags, depending on [3])
[5]: (int) time limit in minutes
[6]: (boolean) cops enabled

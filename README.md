# gta2-hackers-remix
Originally in 2012, this project was supposed to be a split screen mod for the awesome network multiplayer mode of GTA2 (1999). It turns out, that in order to get that working, we'd also need to create a new game controller abstraction. So this is the meta project for the following mods:
* [gamepad_glue](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/tree/master/gamepad_glue): Allow modern XBox360-Controllers and compatible to be used with GTA2 (C, C++)
* [splitscreen_mod](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/tree/master/splitscreen_mod): Ultimate up-to-6-players-on-one-PC GTA2 party modification you should try on your new 4K projector ([AutoIt3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site))

Who knows, we might even add more to the list as soon as the splitscreen_mod is functional! At least we'll need a good looking splitscreen menu.

## current state
From a technical point of view, the splitscreen mod is possible, as all required techniques have been implemented at least once. However, in the current state, this is **not usable at all,** lots of work and a complete rewrite of the old splitscreen code are required to streamline everything.

So don't try to download anything, unless you are a developer and want to help.

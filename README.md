# GTA2 Hacker's Remix
This is a meta-mod for GTA2 (1999), which includes modern game controller support, an all-new fullscreen-menu that can be accessed with such controllers and a **splitscreen mod**. It is written to work well on [Linux](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/wiki/Linux-(Wine)) (some parts run in Wine).

#### Post-Alpha Branch
[Major code restructuring](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/wiki/Post-Alpha-Code-Structure) takes place in this branch, but it has just begun. If you're looking for something playable, check out the latest alpha release of the [master](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/) branch (scroll down to *get the alpha*).

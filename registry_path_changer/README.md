# GTA2 Registry Path Changer
This is a simple C program that modifies the Windows Registry locations in GTA2.exe. Since that information is stored as a bunch of normal strings, the program essentially performs a search and replace, just like most text editors can do.

We need this for the [splitscreen mod](https://github.com/Bytewerk/gta2-hackers-remix/tree/master/splitscreen_mod) (different GTA2.exe with different display resolutions).

This program can be compiled with [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) for example, just create a new empty C program, paste the code and compile.

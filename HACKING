This file is about contributing to the code of GTA2: Hacker's Remix.

Read on if you have some knowledge of GCC/MinGW, C and you would like
to contribute to this mod. First of all, set up your development
environment [1].

The code is roughly divided into four components [2], not counting the
unfinished windows installer [3] and the "src/common" folder, which has
some shared c-code for strings and file operations.

For the C code (that is, the native and menu components), each of these
has a lot of sub-components. What they do is described in the README.md 
hat can be found in src/native and src/menu. Most of these sub-
components can be individually compiled (and therefore tested with
valgrind), because they have a "main_test.c" and "Makefile" right inside
their folder.

Some of these testing Makefiles are probably broken, because they have
not been used a long time and the code around that has been changed. But
mostly they are easy to fix (eg. missing 'out' folder, using the
obsolete 'src/common/cfg' code instead of the newer 'src/common/ini')!

So when modifying these components, always (fix and) run the valgrind
test and find all memory leaks (on Windows, drmemory[4] can be used
instead)!

Please break code lines (also in AutoIt3 if possible) longer than 72
columns, and never use multi-line (#cs, #ce) comments in AutoIt3, as the
custom syntax highlighting can't handle those.


Coding has been mostly a one-man-show, so pull-requests are really
welcome :)
